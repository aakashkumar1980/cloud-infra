# ============================================================================
# AWS Resource Tagging Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This file defines the tagging strategy for all AWS resources across
# different environments. Tags are used for cost allocation, resource
# organization, and compliance tracking.
#
# Structure:
#   - global_tags: Applied to ALL resources regardless of environment
#   - environment_tags: Environment-specific tags (dev, stage, prod)
#
# Usage:
#   These tags are merged in locals.tf and applied to all resources.
#   Global tags are always applied, then environment-specific tags are
#   merged based on the selected profile.
# ============================================================================

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Global Tags
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These tags are applied to all resources across all environments.
# They provide consistent metadata for project identification and ownership.
#
# @field project - Project identifier for resource grouping
# @field managed_by - Infrastructure management tool identifier
# @field owner - Primary owner/team responsible for resources
# @field contact - Contact email for resource owner
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
global_tags:
  project: terraform-aws
  managed_by: terraform
  company: aaditya_designers
  owner: aakash.kumar
  contact: aakash.kumar1980@yahoo.com

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Environment-Specific Tags
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# These tags are applied based on the deployment environment (profile).
# They enable cost tracking, compliance policies, and environment isolation.
#
# Environments:
#   - dev: Development environment for testing and experimentation
#   - stage: Staging environment for pre-production validation
#   - prod: Production environment for live workloads
#
# @field environment - Environment name (dev/stage/prod)
# @field cost_center - Department/team for cost allocation
# @field backup - Backup policy (only for prod)
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
environment_tags:
  # Development Environment Tags
  # Used for R&D and initial feature development
  dev:
    environment: dev
    cost_center: rnd

  # Staging Environment Tags
  # Used for QA testing and pre-production validation
  stage:
    environment: stage
    cost_center: qa

  # Production Environment Tags
  # Used for live production workloads with backup enabled
  prod:
    environment: prod
    cost_center: ops
    backup: enabled
